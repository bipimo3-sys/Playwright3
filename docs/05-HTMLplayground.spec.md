# TS1-HTMLPlayground.spec.js

This suite tests the **"HTML Playground"** feature, a local HTML editor with live preview in an iframe.  
It verifies input handling, live rendering, cross-browser/device behavior, and basic formatting support.  
The suite uses Playwright page automation and frame locators to simulate user interactions and validate iframe content.

## Coverage

1. **UI Availability**: Confirms the textarea and Run button are visible and contain expected default values.  
2. **Default Content Verification**: Ensures the textarea initially contains `<p>Hello Playwright!</p>`.  
3. **HTML Input Handling**: Validates that user-entered HTML is accepted by the textarea.  
4. **Live Rendering in Iframe**: Checks that clicking the Run button renders the updated HTML in the iframe.  
5. **Formatting Support**: Verifies that HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<p>`) are correctly rendered.  
6. **Cross-Browser Verification**: Confirms the feature works on Chromium, Firefox (desktop only for mobile viewports), and WebKit.  
7. **Cross-Device Verification**: Tests functionality on Desktop, Mobile, and Pixel 5 viewport/device settings.  
8. **Visual Verification**: Captures screenshots before and after running HTML code for traceability and validation.  

## Techniques Demonstrated

* Page automation using Playwright (`page.goto`, `page.fill`, `page.click`)  
* Frame handling via `frameLocator` for live HTML content verification  
* Cross-browser and responsive/device testing  
* Screenshots for pre/post-render visual validation and error attachments  
* Reusable test function (`iframeTest`) for DRY test design  

## Purpose

Ensures the HTML Playground allows users to enter, edit, and preview HTML accurately, and works consistently across browsers and devices with proper rendering in an iframe.
