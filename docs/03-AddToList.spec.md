# TS1-AddToList.spec.js

This test suite verifies the functionality of the **"Add to List"** feature, ensuring that user input is validated, items are appended correctly, and UI behavior follows expected logic.  
It interacts with `TS1_AddToList.html` and tests both **positive and negative scenarios** using Playwright.

## Coverage

1. **UI Availability**: Confirms that the input field and **“Add to List”** button are visible and enabled.  
2. **Single Item Addition**: Ensures entered text appears as a new list item.  
3. **Multiple Items Handling**: Validates sequential additions and correct item count/order.  
4. **Input Validation**: Displays an error when submitting an empty field.  
5. **Field Reset**: Confirms the input field clears after successful add.  
6. **Message Visibility**: Checks that the error message hides after valid input.  
7. **List Content Verification**: Ensures list text matches user entries.  
8. **Focus Management**: Verifies cursor returns to input field post-add.  
9. **Duplicate Handling**: Confirms duplicates are allowed and displayed distinctly.  

## Techniques Demonstrated

* Parallelized test execution (`test.describe.parallel`)  
* Form interaction (`fill`, `click`, `inputValue`, `evaluate`)  
* Conditional assertions and dynamic DOM validation  
* Sequential user input simulation and list verification  
* UI state testing (error message visibility, focus behavior)  
* Screenshot capture and error attachment with timestamps
